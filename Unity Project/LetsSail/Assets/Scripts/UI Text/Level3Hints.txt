Look for Mainsail. The largest sail that captures the wind's power to propel the boat. Understanding how to control this sail is key to managing the boat's speed and direction.
Look for Jib (or Jib sail). A smaller sail found in front of the main sail. It helps with the boat's balance and speed, and managing it is crucial for efficient sailing.
Look for Mainsheet. The line on a keelboat controlling the mainsail's angle to the wind, pivotal for optimizing sailing efficiency and direction. It is usually attached via a system of pulleys to the aft end of the boom.
Look for Jibsheet. A rope on a keelboat that adjusts the jib's position, crucial for balancing sail power and maneuvering, especially when tacking or jibing.
Look for Lifeline. A line that runs above a boat's decks or spars to provide something for sailors to grasp if they fall or are washed away.
Look for Spreader. An integral component of a sailboat's rigging, playing a vital role in distributing the forces applied to the mast and stabilizing the structure of the rig.
Look for Backstay. A critical piece of rigging on a sailboat, designed to support the mast from the stern (back) of the boat.
Look for Shroud. A key component of the rigging system on a sailboat, consisting of one of the sets of cables or ropes that run vertically from the mast's top (or near the top) down to the sides of the vessel.
