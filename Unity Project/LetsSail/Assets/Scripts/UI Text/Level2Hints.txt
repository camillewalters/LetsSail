Look for Keel. A fixed appendage on the bottom of the hull that provides sideways resistance needed to counter the force of the wind on the sails. The keel also carries ballast, usually iron or lead, the weight of which counteracts the force of the wind that causes a sailboat to heel, or lean over.
Look for Rudder. Located beneath the boat, the rudder is a flat piece of material used to steer. It's controlled by the helm (steering mechanism), which is essential for navigating.
Look for Tiller. It's used to pivot the rudder of a boat in order to control the boat's direction.
Look for Mast. A pole that rises vertically from the deck of a boat and supports sails.
Look for Winch. A mechanical device used to tighten or loosen lines with minimal effort, essential for sail adjustments and control.
Look for Boom. A horizontal pole that attaches to the mast and extends the foot (bottom) of the mainsail.
