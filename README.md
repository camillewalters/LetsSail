# letssail

LetsSail is React and Unity-based to teach people how to sail. This project was developed with credits to the following assets:

-[J-80 Sailboat](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/j-80-sailboat-681513987f464be48add6cb69580f9c5), a 3D sailboat model

- [Quick Outline](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/quick-outline-115488), a Unity Asset used to outline objects

- [LowPoly Survival Character Rio] (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/lowpoly-survival-character-rio-273074), a humanoid Unity Asset

- [Storm-Breakers](https://github.com/Stormrider31/Storm-Breakers), a Unity package used to simulate the ocean

- [Doktor](https://github.com/stackfoss/doktor), a Next.js template which provided the inspiration for the website
