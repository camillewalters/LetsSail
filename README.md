# LetsSail

LetsSail is React and Unity-based game to teach people how to sail. This project was developed with credits to the following assets:

- [J-80 Sailboat](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/j-80-sailboat-681513987f464be48add6cb69580f9c5), a 3D sailboat model

- [Quick Outline](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/quick-outline-115488), a Unity Asset used to outline objects

- [LowPoly Survival Character Rio](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/lowpoly-survival-character-rio-273074), a humanoid Unity Asset

- [Storm-Breakers](https://github.com/Stormrider31/Storm-Breakers), a Unity package used to simulate the ocean

- [Fantasy Landscape](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy-landscape-103573), a Unity Asset used for landscapes

- [48px Gesture Icons](https://www.figma.com/community/file/809271168141873252), a Figma design file used for our UI buttons

- [Doktor](https://github.com/stackfoss/doktor), a Next.js template which provided the inspiration for the website

We also used the following technologies (and highly recommend them!):

- [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/), to animate the humanoid model
- [Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/), for UI components
- [React Unity WebGL](https://github.com/jeffreylanters/react-unity-webgl), to communicate to and from WebGL to React
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), to manipulate the sailboat model
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main), to build the website
